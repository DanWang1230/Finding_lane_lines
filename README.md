## Reflection

### 1. Describe the pipeline.

My pipeline consists of the following steps. Here, I took solidWhiteCurve.jpg as an example to illustrate the pipeline.
![alt text][image4]
First, I converted the images to grayscale.

Then I used Gaussian smoothing and Canny edge detection to find the edges.

After that, I created a mask to mask out the regions that are not of interest.

Then I applied the Hough transform to find the line information and drew the lines on the original image.
![alt text][image1]
Based on the lines obtained from the Hough transform, I assigned the lines to two sets: left lane and right lane, taking into consideration the slopes of the lines. In order to draw a single line on each of the left and right lanes, I respectively found the average of the two sets. Below is the result after this averaging step.

Then I extrapolated and extended the two lanes to the bottom and top limits.

Note that I didn't modify the draw_lines() function but instead modified the "main" file directly.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with current pipeline

* The parameters need to be tuned carefully, which is time-consuming.
* The method only identifies lines and will not work with curves.
* The method also will not work when two lanes are merging into one wider lane since we will lose the information of one lane with the fixed mask.


### 3. Suggest possible improvements

* One possible solution is to use not only line detection but also curve detection.
* Using masks with adaptive sizes instead of a fixed-size mask
